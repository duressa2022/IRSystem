ai
enabling
computers
to
learn
from
and
make
decisions

this
essay
delves
into
the
essence
of
machine
learning
algorithms
covering
their
types
common
techniques
applications
and
the
challenges
they
face
types
of
machine
learning
algorithms
machine
learning
algorithms
can
be
broadly
categorized
into
three
types
supervised
learning
unsupervised
learning
and
reinforcement
learning
supervised
learning
in
supervised
learning
the
algorithm
is
trained
on
a
labeled
dataset
meaning
that
each
training
example
is
paired
with
an
output
label
the
goal
is
to
learn
a
mapping
from
inputs
to
outputs
that
can
be
used
to
predict
the
labels
of
new
unseen
examples
common
supervised
learning
algorithms
include
linear
regression
logistic
regression
support
vector
machines
svm
and
neural
networks
unsupervised
learning
unlike
supervised
learning
unsupervised
learning
algorithms
work
with
unlabeled
data
the
aim
is
to
infer
the
natural
structure
present
within
a
set
of
data
points
key
techniques
in
unsupervised
learning
include
clustering
e.g
k-means
hierarchical
clustering
and
dimensionality
reduction
e.g
principal
component
analysis
pca
t-distributed
stochastic
neighbor
embedding
t-sne
reinforcement
learning
in
reinforcement
learning
an
agent
learns
to
make
decisions
by
performing
actions
in
an
environment
to
maximize
some
notion
of
cumulative
reward
this
type
of
learning
is
particularly
useful
in
scenarios
where
the
sequence
of
actions
is
crucial
such
as
in
game
playing
or
robotic
control
notable
algorithms
in
this
category
include
q-learning
deep
q-networks
dqn
and
policy
gradient
methods
common
machine
learning
algorithms
supervised
learning
algorithms
linear
regression
linear
regression
is
used
for
predicting
a
continuous
variable
based
on
one
or
more
input
features
it
assumes
a
linear
relationship
between
the
input
variables
and
the
output
logistic
regression
logistic
regression
is
used
for
binary
classification
problems
it
models
the
probability
that
a
given
input
point
belongs
to
a
particular
class
decision
trees
decision
trees
are
models
that
make
decisions
based
on
a
series
of
binary
questions
each
node
in
the
tree
represents
a
feature
and
each
branch
represents
a
decision
rule
leading
to
a
leaf
node
with
the
predicted
output
support
vector
machines
svm
svms
are
powerful
for
both
classification
and
regression
tasks
they
work
by
finding
the
hyperplane
that
best
separates
the
classes
in
the
feature
space
neural
networks
neural
networks
are
a
set
of
algorithms
modeled
loosely
after
the
human
brain
designed
to
recognize
patterns
they
consist
of
layers
of
interconnected
nodes
or
neurons
where
each
connection
has
a
weight
that
adjusts
as
learning
proceeds
unsupervised
learning
algorithms
k-means
clustering
k-means
clustering
partitions
data
into
k
distinct
clusters
based
on
feature
similarity
each
cluster
is
represented
by
its
centroid
and
each
data
point
is
assigned
to
the
nearest
centroid
hierarchical
clustering
this
algorithm
builds
a
hierarchy
of
clusters
by
either
merging
smaller
clusters
into
larger
ones
agglomerative
or
splitting
larger
clusters
into
smaller
ones
divisive
principal
component
analysis
pca
pca
is
a
dimensionality
reduction
technique
that
transforms
data
into
a
set
of
orthogonal
components
ordered
by
the
amount
of
variance
they
explain
t-distributed
stochastic
neighbor
embedding
t-sne
t-sne
is
a
technique
for
dimensionality
reduction
that
is
particularly
well-suited
for
visualizing
high-dimensional
data
in
two
or
three
dimensions
reinforcement
learning
algorithms
q-learning
q-learning
is
a
model-free
reinforcement
learning
algorithm
that
seeks
to
learn
the
value
of
an
action
in
a
particular
state
it
uses
a
q-table
to
store
these
values
and
updates
them
based
on
the
received
rewards
deep
q-networks
dqn
dqn
combines
q-learning
with
deep
neural
networks
to
handle
environments
with
large
state
spaces
it
uses
experience
replay
and
target
networks
to
stabilize
learning
policy
gradient
methods
these
methods
optimize
the
policy
directly
by
maximizing
the
expected
reward
