form
the

historical
background
the
concept
of
algorithms
dates
back
to
ancient
times
the
term
algorithm
itself
is
derived
from
the
name
of
the
persian
mathematician
al-khwarizmi
who
made
significant
contributions
to
algebra
and
introduced
systematic
procedures
for
solving
equations
in
the
th
century
however
the
idea
of
algorithms
has
been
present
in
various
forms
throughout
history
in
the
early
th
century
the
formal
study
of
algorithms
gained
prominence
with
the
development
of
mathematical
logic
and
the
foundations
of
computer
science
alan
turing
a
british
mathematician
and
logician
made
groundbreaking
contributions
with
his
theoretical
model
known
as
the
turing
machine
which
laid
the
groundwork
for
modern
computer
science
and
the
theory
of
computation
turing's
work
on
the
entscheidungsproblem
decision
problem
demonstrated
that
there
are
limits
to
what
can
be
computed
algorithmically
fundamental
concepts
complexity
algorithmic
complexity
measured
in
terms
of
time
and
space
is
a
key
concept
in
the
study
of
algorithms
time

refers
to
the
amount
of
time
an
algorithm
takes
to
complete
as
a
function
of
the
size
of
its
input
space
complexity
on
the
other
hand
refers
to
the
amount
of
memory
an
algorithm
uses
during
its
execution
the
big
o
notation

commonly
used
to
describe
the
upper
bound
of
an
algorithm's
complexity
providing
a
way
to
compare
the
efficiency
of
different
algorithms
efficiency
the
efficiency

an
algorithm
is
critical

resource
usage
and
optimize
performance
for
example
searching
algorithms

binary
search
are
much
more
efficient
than
linear
search
for
large
datasets
as
binary
search
reduces
the
search
space
by
half
with
each
step
correctness
an
algorithm
must
produce
the
correct
output
for
all
possible
valid
inputs
this
involves
proving
that
the
algorithm
terminates
halting
problem
and
that
it
produces
the
expected
result

induction
and
invariants

merge
sort
a
divide-and-conquer
algorithm
