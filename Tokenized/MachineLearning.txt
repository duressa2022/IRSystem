historical
background
the
origins

mid-20th
century
in

alan
turing
proposed
the
idea
of
a

machine
that
could
improve
its
performance
over
time
his
concept
laid
the

an
agent
to
make
decisions
by
interacting
with
an
environment
the
agent
receives
feedback
in
the
form
of

actions
and
learns
to
maximize
cumulative
rewards
over
